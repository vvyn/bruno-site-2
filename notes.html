    - to get 90px then 90/16 === ---%
    - % and em better for accessibility
    - static(px) vs dynamic (%, em)
    - (em & %)fontsize gets inheritated and added to whatever additional changes to size
    - ex. body+h1 font size
    - rem ==== not inheritated, ignores all parent sizes
    - use rem when sizing text


    float
    - float: left/right/etc;
    - let's u put an element next to an element
    - photo next to text
    - used to wrap text around a certain element
    - dont use too often

    clear
    - clear: left/right/etc;
    - let's you clear an area to a direction of an element
    - clearing area left to text, which is a picture, moves text to another line
